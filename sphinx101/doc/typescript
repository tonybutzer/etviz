[01mWelcome to the Sphinx 3.2.1 quickstart utility.[39;49;00m

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

[01mSelected root path: .[39;49;00m

You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
"source" and "build" directories within the root path.
[35m> Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: [39;49;00my

The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
[35m> Project name: [39;49;00metviz
[35m> Author name(s): [39;49;00mTony Butzer
[35m> Project release []: [39;49;00m1.0

If the documents are to be written in a language other than English,
you can select a language here by its language code. Sphinx will then
translate text that it generates into that language.

For a list of supported codes, see
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-language.

You should now populate your master file /home/jupyter-butzer/opt/etviz/sphinx101/doc/source/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

$ ls
