6. Open Data Cube and PANGEO
7. Science work flows

# Notaional Memo of Understanding

1. Michell's team to help vizualize VegET data in the cloud - for Agro-Hydro Modelling
2. Tony to help define and writeup path to the cloud for scientists and their data
3. Both teams to try to leverage combined project fundings and goals and thereby establish a symbionic relastionship with cost and deliverable benefits
4. Starts out as a prototype and investigation - with an empahsis on practical technology demonstrations


# Actions

1. get geoserver geo? software running in the AWS CHS Cloud
	- start up a t3a-2xlarge EC2 instance running CentOS
	- get code and install instructions from michelle


# ErosGeoEngine5

Hi, Tony:
I've given you access to our Confluence space EROS GeoEngine5.  Reza wrote up a page for UCSB to deploy our v1.0.5 and it is here:   
- https://my.usgs.gov/confluence/display/ErosGeoengine5/G5+v1.0.5+Deployment+to+UCSB

Those instructions may need to be tweaked for later releases although I haven't had a chance to look at that.  Our current release is tagged as v1.0.7, and I think you should start with that , as the database schema has several changes from v1.0.5.

Code base is in GitLab: 
- https://eroslab.cr.usgs.gov/SCIENCE/geoengine5
You should be able to access it, let me or Michelle know if you have problems.

Thanks!
Cheryl Holen
KBR | Software Engineer III
